# TODO:

#### 1- Create countdown before the result. (3,2,1)
#### 2- make the css cleaner and better.
#### 3- Make so that the 'numbers' don't come down when the result comes. Popup maybe?
#### 4- Change css borders/background color. Very hard to read.
#### 5- When creating a new raffle, make it so that it asks if the user is sure. If so, create a new but refreshes the raffle section.
#### 6- Make it so that the 'sorteio' page saves each line in the localstorage.
